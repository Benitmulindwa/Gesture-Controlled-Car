# Gesture-Controlled-Car
The Gesture-Controlled Car Project allows users to control a car's movement using hand gestures captured by a webcam. By leveraging the power of Python, OpenCV, Mediapipe, and Arduino, this project brings together computer vision, real-time hand gesture recognition, and hardware communication to create an engaging and intuitive user experience.
